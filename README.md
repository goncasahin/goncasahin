I am enthusiastic about data science, machine learning and deep learning.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I focused on data science. I am now a certified IBM Data Science Professional and have completed additional certified courses on machine learning and deep learning. I have a solid understanding of the field and I can independently analyze data, build machine learning models and create data visualizations.

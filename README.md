I am a data scientist enthusiastic about machine learning & deep learning and an architect specialised in building physics.

I finished my masters degree at TU/e as an exchange student and have been living with my partner in Eindhoven since. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I studied data science. This field was intriguing to me, because of its applications for the built environment (cities are amongst the biggest data producers). While reinforcing my skills in data science, I have been caught up by dealing with data day by day and soon I decided to make a career switch. I am now a certified IBM Data Science Professional and have completed additional certified courses on machine learning and deep learning. I have a solid understanding of the field and I can independently analyse data,  build machine learning models and create data visualisations.
